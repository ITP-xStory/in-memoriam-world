# In Memoriam World
In Memoriam is an open-ended, multi-user virtual reality experience that presents a future in which nature is preserved in synthetic monuments. Two participants enter a surreal world of tree-like structures, open water, and sounds from the past. Entering at two different locations in the landscape, guests are tasked to find each other while exploring the artificial forest.
